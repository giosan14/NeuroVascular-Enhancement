# Background

One of the areas of study or specialization in the medical field that has a high level of complexity is neurology. The studies conducted in this field are crucial as they can determine certain anomalies that may be causing ailments in the body, from headaches to blocked arteries or veins that can lead to a stroke.

Therefore, studies must be conducted with the utmost precision to help define ailments in patients and thereby save lives. One of the most common studies conducted is cerebral angiography, where a video X-ray study is performed to obtain images of cerebral vascularization and the irrigation of arteries or veins in the brain. This study determines the arteries or veins of the brain that may be compromised by any ailment or accident, by injecting a fluid into the arteries or veins that reacts to the rays emitted by the equipment, causing the arteries to appear white.

From certain filtering operations performed by the equipment, a black and white image is obtained, which allows the identification of areas of interest within the study. Typically, these studies are in video format, and frames can be paused to acquire a particular image.

# Introduction

This project describes the proposal for filtering images from cerebral angiographies. These images contain various anatomical features such as organs, hair, arteries, veins, and skin. The purpose is to assist in the visualization of arteries of interest for a more accurate diagnosis of potentially damaged areas or for routine studies.

Within the areas of interest, we specify the branches of vascularization from secondary to tertiary in the cerebral region, i.e., arterial sub-branchings originating from the main ones.

# Code Development

Four filters are proposed for thresholding the areas of interest. These are the general steps followed to obtain the thresholded image:

1. WaterShed:
   a. Image reading.
   b. Image enhancement.
   c. Noise removal.
   d. Background differentiation.
   e. Area differentiation.
   f. Zone subtraction.

2. OTZU:
   a. Image reading.
   b. Image enhancement.
   c. Noise removal.
   d. OTZU thresholding.

3. BlockSize:
   a. Image reading.
   b. Image enhancement.
   c. Noise removal.
   d. BlockSize thresholding.

4. TRUNC:
   a. Image reading.
   b. Image enhancement.
   c. Noise removal.
   d. TRUNC thresholding.

5. Erosion:
   a. Image reading.
   b. Image enhancement.
   c. Noise removal.
   d. Erosion thresholding.

6. Dilatation:
   a. Image reading.
   b. Image enhancement.
   c. Noise removal.
   d. Dilatation thresholding.

7. Opening and Closing:
   a. Image reading.
   b. Image enhancement.
   c. Noise removal.

# Thresholding Results

1. WaterShed:
   The resulting image from this thresholding appears very noisy, with many pixels making it difficult to make a precise diagnosis of the areas of interest.

2. OTZU:
   The resulting image from this thresholding shows the areas of interest more clearly, providing a more detailed image. However, there is some noise generated by the eyes and areas near the skull.

3. BlockSize:
   The resulting image from this thresholding shows the areas of interest more subtly compared to OTZU. There is less interference from noise generated by the eyes and areas near the skull. However, due to the subtlety of the thresholding, not all arteries of the skull are visible.

4. TRUNC:
   The resulting image from this thresholding is similar to the original image but with more detailed tones, providing a clearer visualization of the arteries and giving them a sense of depth.

5. Erosion:
   The resulting image from this thresholding generates a mask of cerebral arteries. This generated image presents noise but can provide more detailed information about damaged arteries, as we can observe their shape, which is tubular. Any damaged artery will have a shape different from that of a tube.

6. Dilatation:
   The resulting image from this thresholding is somewhat difficult to distinguish due to its high brightness. The arteries can be distinguished poorly, causing superimposed arteries to form some alteration.

7. Opening and Closing:
   The resulting image from this thresholding has low definition but excellent identification of the arteries. With this image, the arteries and their ramifications can be discerned. However, smaller arteries begin to disappear due to pixels, meaning the artery is visible but not in its entirety.
